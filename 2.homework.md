# Unit Testing

The goal of the homework is creation of unit tests for SafeRoute and RDWToken smart contract.

NOTE: It is required to complete first homework before this homework.

## Requirements
- up and running Ethereum RPC client (you can check in in prev homework)
- truffle

## Example
There is small example ``HelloWorld.js`` in test directory.

## How to start?
1. You need to create test file in ``test`` directory. The file should have the same name as contract file.
2. Start testing, put initial code into your file (test example for RDWToken smart contract):
    ```
    var RDWToken = artifacts.require("RDWToken");

    contract('RDWToken', function(accounts) {
      let contract;

      beforeEach(async () => {
        contract = await RDWToken.new();
      });

      it("should put 10000 RDWToken in the first account", async function() {
        //act
        await contract.mint(10000, {from: accounts[0]});

        //assert
        const balance = await contract.balanceOf(accounts[0]);
        assert.equal(parseInt(balance), 10000, "10000 wasn't in the first account");
      });

      ...
    });
    ```

    NOTES:
    - Each test has structure like:
    ```
    it("description", async function() {
      //arrange
      //act
      //assert
    });
    ```

    - Each test can access global variable ``accounts``. The variable contains all accounts which truffle has generated for you. You can use account to execute you smart contracts from different users (eg RoadManager)

    - Each test has own instance of smart contract. The code allows to deploy new smart contract before each test:
    ```
    beforeEach(async () => {
      contract = await RDWToken.new();
    });
    ```

  - Creation of ``SafeRoute`` contract looks like:
    ```
    contract = await SafeRoute.new("0xd0cc1e44a5", "https://pointer", tokenContract.address);
    ```

3. Run unit tests

    Execute in terminal:
    ```
    truffle test
    ```

## Test scenarios
- RDWtoken
  - mint tokens (example above)
  - mint tokens twice, assert balance
  - tranfer tokens, assert balances
  - transfer token when not enough balance (should throw exception)
- SafeRoute
  - addRoadManager, assert balance of ``contract.address``
  - addRoadManager under ``accounts[1]`` (should throw exception)
    
    to do this you need to run code like:
    ```
    contract.addRoadManager(accounts[1], 1, {from: accounts[1]});
    ```
  - withdraw by non existent roadManager (should throw exception)
  - withdraw by existent roadManager, assert balances

## How to push your homework?
You need to have github account to do this.
1. Login to GitHub
2. Create fork of repository https://github.com/LedgerLeopard/masterclass
3. Clone repository https://github.com/{your_account}/masterclass
4. Write code
5. Commit your changes to local reporitory
6. Push your changes into master
7. Create Pull Request to original repository
